A common structure involves 4 pairs (8) of pinnae, and each pinna has 2 rows of leaflets. Contraction of the pulvini at the base of the pinnae causes them to droop.

        correctAnswerText: "a- To increase the receptive surface area for receiving signals from other neurons.<br>b- Myelin sheath allows for saltatory conduction (jumping between Nodes of Ranvier), which is much faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons.<br>c- They connect sensory and motor neurons within the CNS, acting as intermediates, integrating information and relaying signals.",

        correctAnswerText: "a- Due to the unidirectional nature of synaptic transmission, where neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal of the presynaptic neuron and received by dendrites/cell body of the postsynaptic neuron, signals flow in one direction along a neural pathway.<br>b- Contains nucleus, RER (Nissl granules), Golgi, mitochondria; site of metabolism and signal integration.",
