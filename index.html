        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        correctAnswerText: "a) hydrogen bonds.",
        explanation: "According to page 72, hydrogen bonds are the physical bonds formed between water molecules, specifically between the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the highly electronegative oxygen atom of another. Ionic bonds (page 82) are formed by electron transfer. Metallic bonds (page 75) exist in metals. Coordinate bonds (page 72) can be formed by water in specific reactions (e.g., forming H₃O⁺) but are not the primary bond type between pure water molecules."

            "d) H₂O"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        correctAnswerText: "c) HCl",
        explanation: "Page 72 lists HF, H₂O, and NH₃ as examples of compounds with hydrogen bonds. It specifies that hydrogen bonding occurs when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms like F, O, and N. While HCl has a polar H-Cl bond, chlorine is less electronegative than F, O, or N, and HCl does not form significant hydrogen bonds compared to the other options listed. Thus, HCl is the exception among the given options."

        question: "3) What are the types of the bonds which are found in ethanol CH₃CH₂OH ?",
        options: [
            "a) Single and double covalent bonds.",
            "b) Single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.",
            "c) Double covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.",
            "d) Single and double covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        correctAnswerText: "b) Single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.",
        explanation: "Within an ethanol molecule (CH₃CH₂OH), the atoms are linked by single covalent bonds (C-C, C-H, O-H). The presence of the polar O-H group allows ethanol molecules to form hydrogen bonds with each other (similar to water on page 72). Ethanol does not contain double covalent bonds. Therefore, the bonds present are single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds."

            "b) C₂H₄ and HCOOC₄H₉",
            "c) CH₃COOH and CH₃CH₃",
            "d) PH₃ and HF"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 0,
        correctAnswerText: "a) CH₃COOH and C₂H₅OH",
        explanation: "Hydrogen bonds form between molecules containing an H atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (O, N, F) and an electronegative atom with a lone pair in another molecule (Page 72). Both acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and ethanol (C₂H₅OH) contain O-H groups, making them capable of forming hydrogen bonds with each other. Option b includes ethene (C₂H₄), which cannot form hydrogen bonds. Option c includes ethane (CH₃CH₃), which cannot form hydrogen bonds. Option d includes PH₃ which does not form significant hydrogen bonds."

            "c) covalent bonds only.",
            "d) both covalent and hydrogen bonds."
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3,
        correctAnswerText: "d) both covalent and hydrogen bonds.",
        explanation: "Pure water (H₂O) molecules contain polar covalent bonds between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms within the molecule. Between water molecules, hydrogen bonds are formed (Page 72). Thus, pure water contains both types of bonds."

        ],
        correctAnswer: 2,
        correctAnswerText: "c) higher than 1",
        explanation: "Each water molecule has 2 covalent O-H bonds. In liquid water, each molecule is involved in an average of less than 4 hydrogen bonds. Since each hydrogen bond connects two molecules, the total number of hydrogen bonds is less than twice the number of molecules. The total number of covalent bonds is twice the number of molecules. Therefore, the ratio of covalent bonds to hydrogen bonds (2N / (N * avg_H_bonds / 2) = 4 / avg_H_bonds) is greater than 1, as avg_H_bonds < 4."

        correctAnswer: 3,
        correctAnswerText: "d) H₂O",
        explanation: "Water (H₂O) forms hydrogen bonds between molecules (Page 72). Water can also form coordinate bonds, for example, by donating a lone pair from its oxygen atom to a proton (H⁺) to form the hydronium ion (H₃O⁺), as described on page 72. Cl₂, HCl, and CH₄ do not readily form both types of bonds. While HCl can form weak hydrogen bonds, its ability to form coordinate bonds is not typical in this context."

        explanation: "NH₃ forms hydrogen bonds due to the polar N-H bonds and the presence of a lone pair on the highly electronegative Nitrogen atom (Page 72). PH₃ does not form significant hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonding is a strong intermolecular force that requires more energy to overcome, leading to a much higher boiling point for NH₃ compared to PH₃ (Page 71-72). The other options describe properties of NH₃ but do not explain the difference in boiling point compared to PH₃, which is primarily due to the presence of hydrogen bonding in NH₃."

        explanation: "The boiling points of HF, NH₃, and H₂O are higher than expected based on their molar masses due to hydrogen bonding (Page 71-72). H₂S does not form significant hydrogen bonds (Page 71). The strength of hydrogen bonding affects boiling points (Page 72 G.R.). Hydrogen bonds in HF are generally stronger than in NH₃ (due to larger electronegativity difference and geometry effects, Page 73-74). NH₃ hydrogen bonds are weaker than in H₂O (Page 74). H₂S has a very low boiling point (-61°C, Page 71). Among the given options, the order HF > NH₃ > H₂S correctly reflects the relative influence of hydrogen bonding on boiling points."

        explanation: "This concept is likely covered in a previous lesson, as ionic bond definition is not explicitly on pages 82-85. Ionic bonds are formed by the electrostatic attraction between a cation (positive ion, usually from a metal) and an anion (negative ion, usually from a nonmetal). Metals that readily form ionic bonds tend to have large atomic size and low ionization energy, easily losing electrons. Nonmetals that readily gain electrons, like halogens (Group 7A, seen on page 83) and elements from Group 6A (seen on page 83), typically have high electron affinities and high electronegativities. Option b accurately describes these characteristics."

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        correctAnswerText: "b) PH₃, H₃O⁺",
        explanation: "Coordinate bonds are formed when one atom donates a lone pair to another atom or ion to form a covalent bond. H₃O⁺ (hydronium ion) is formed by H₂O accepting an H⁺, with oxygen donating a lone pair to form a coordinate bond. H₃O⁺ also contains O-H covalent bonds. Thus, H₃O⁺ contains both covalent and coordinate bonds (Page 72). PH₃ (phosphine) contains P-H covalent bonds and a lone pair on phosphorus, enabling it to form coordinate bonds (e.g., in PH₄⁺). While PH₃ itself only contains covalent bonds, H₃O⁺ contains both. This option pairs a species with both types (H₃O⁺) with a species containing covalent bonds and capable of forming coordinate bonds (PH₃)."

        explanation: "In NH₃, the central N atom is sp³ hybridized, surrounded by 3 bonding pairs and 1 lone pair. The electron domains are arranged tetrahedrally. The molecular shape (stereostructure), which considers only the atoms, is trigonal pyramidal. The VSEPR abbreviation is AX₃E. The bond angle is approximately 107°.

        explanation: "Sodium acetate (CH₃COONa) is an ionic compound consisting of Na⁺ cations and acetate anions (CH₃COO⁻). Sigma bonds are covalent bonds formed by head-to-head overlap of orbitals. Within the acetate anion (H₃C-C(=O)-O⁻), there are: 3 C-H sigma bonds, 1 C-C sigma bond, 1 sigma bond in the C=O double bond, and 1 C-O⁻ sigma bond. This totals 6 sigma bonds within the acetate anion. The bond between Na⁺ and CH₃COO⁻ is ionic, not covalent (sigma). The provided answer key indicates that there are 7 sigma bonds (option c).

        correctAnswerText: "b) X and Y",
        explanation: "The diagram shows labels for electron domains in a water molecule (lone pairs and bonding pairs). Electron domain repulsion strength follows the order: Lone pair-Lone pair > Lone pair-Bond pair > Bond pair-Bond pair. W represents a lone pair domain, and X, Y, Z represent parts of bonding pair domains. The repulsion between a lone pair and a bonding pair (like W and X, or W and Y, or W and Z) is stronger than the repulsion between two bonding pairs (like X and Y, or Y and Z, or X and Z). Thus, the strongest repulsion involving the labeled parts should be between a lone pair and a bonding pair. However, the provided answer key indicates that the strongest repulsion is between X and Y (option b), which are parts of two different bonding pairs, representing a bond pair-bond pair repulsion. This contradicts the standard VSEPR theory repulsion order, which ranks bond pair-bond pair repulsion as the weakest type. The answer is provided according to the key, noting this discrepancy with standard VSEPR theory which predicts LP-BP repulsion to be stronger than BP-BP repulsion."

        correctAnswerText: "a) 1 pair.",
        explanation: "The figure shows the structure H-O-C-C-NH₂. Let's count the lone pairs on each atom based on completing their octets and respecting valencies (H=1, O=2, C=4, N=3 bonds typically). Oxygen (O) forms 2 bonds (to H and C) and has 6 valence electrons, so it has 6 - 2(shared) = 4 non-bonding electrons, forming 2 lone pairs. Carbon (C) atoms form 4 bonds and have 0 lone pairs. Nitrogen (N) forms 3 bonds (to C and 2 H) and has 5 valence electrons, so it has 5 - 3(shared) = 2 non-bonding electrons, forming 1 lone pair. The total number of lone pairs in the molecule is 2 (on O) + 1 (on N) = 3 lone pairs. However, the provided answer key indicates that there is only 1 lone pair (option a).

        explanation: "Alkali metals are elements in Group 1A (except H) with a valence electron configuration of ns¹ (Page 90). Option a (2,1) is 1s² 2s¹ (Li). Option b is likely a typo and meant [Ar] 4s¹ (K). Option d is [Xe] 6s¹ (Cs). These are all alkali metals. Option c lists [Ar] followed by 4s², 3d¹⁰, 4p⁶, 5s¹.

However, removing a second electron from a sodium atom (or any alkali metal) requires removing it from a very stable, complete electron shell (noble gas configuration).

        correctAnswerText: "c) has lower ability to be ionized.",
        explanation: "Potassium (K) and Cesium (Cs) are both alkali metals, with Cs located below K in Group 1A. Atomic mass (a) increases down the group. Atomic size (b) increases down the group (Page 92), so Cs has a larger atomic size than K. Chemical activity (d) increases down the group (Page 92), so Cs is more active than K. Ionization potential decreases down the group (Page 90), meaning it is easier to remove an electron (higher ability to be ionized). Thus, Cs has a lower ionization potential than K, implying a higher ability to be ionized. The phrase lower ability to be ionized in option c appears to be an error in wording and likely meant lower ionization potential or higher ability to be ionized. The provided answer key indicates option c is correct. Assuming lower ability to be ionized is meant to imply some characteristic that differentiates it from K in the intended answer, and acknowledging the conflict with standard chemical trends, the answer is provided according to the key, noting the discrepancy in phrasing or underlying concept."

Although in the alkali metal section, the question asks about cations. Barium gives a characteristic green flame, sometimes described as yellowish-green or apple green.

        correctAnswerText: "c) M₂O",
        explanation: "A metal with the largest atomic size in its period is an alkali metal (Group 1A) (Page 92). The phrase electrons are distributed in 6 energy sublevels is unclear and appears inconsistent with alkali metals, implying a potential error in the questions description. Ignoring this potentially erroneous part, we focus on M being an alkali metal. Page 95 describes the oxides formed when alkali metals are burnt in pure oxygen: Li forms M₂O (normal oxide), Na forms M₂O₂ (peroxide), and K, Rb, Cs form MO₂ (superoxides). M₂O is the formula for a normal oxide. While burning in pure oxygen typically produces peroxide or superoxide for most alkali metals, Lithium forms Li₂O (M₂O). Given that M₂O (option c) is provided as the correct answer in the key, it suggests that the intended metal M is Lithium, and the question is asking for the formula of Lithium oxide formed upon burning in oxygen. Therefore, the formula of the oxide formed is M₂O, which is a normal oxide."

        correctAnswer: 0, // Answer based on the provided key on Page 47.
        correctAnswerText: "a) According to the chemical activity : Z < Y < X",
        explanation: "Based on the oxide formed when burnt in pure oxygen (Page 95): X forms X₂O (normal oxide), so X is Lithium (Li). Y forms Y₂O₂ (peroxide), so Y is Sodium (Na). Z forms ZO₂ (superoxide), so Z is Potassium (K), Rubidium (Rb), or Cesium (Cs). The chemical activity of alkali metals increases down the group (Li < Na < K < Rb < Cs) (Page 92). Thus, the order of activity is X < Y < Z. Option b is correct; Z can be Rubidium as Rb forms a superoxide. Option c is incorrect; peroxides like Y₂O₂ are strong oxidizing agents (Page 96). Option d refers to oxidation numbers of oxygen: in Z (superoxide, -½), Y (peroxide, -1), X (normal oxide, -2) (Page 95). The order of oxidation number is -½ > -1 > -2, so Z > Y > X. The order of absolute values is ½ < 1 < 2, so Z < Y < X. Let's check option a. It states the chemical activity order is Z < Y < X. This contradicts the established trend X < Y < Z.

The stoichiometry of the reaction shows that 4 moles of KO₂ react with 2 moles of CO₂ to produce 3 moles of O₂. We are given 60 mol of KO₂. We can use the mole ratios from the balanced equation to find the moles of CO₂ consumed (X) and O₂ produced (Y): For CO₂ (X): (60 mol KO₂) * (2 mol CO₂ / 4 mol KO₂) = 30 mol CO₂. For O₂ (Y): (60 mol KO₂) * (3 mol O₂ / 4 mol KO₂) = 45 mol O₂. Therefore, X = 30 mol and Y = 45 mol. Option c matches these values."

        correctAnswerText: "a) NaF",
        explanation: "Sodium halides (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI) are ionic compounds. The melting point of ionic compounds is influenced by the strength of the electrostatic attraction between the ions in the crystal lattice. This attraction is stronger for smaller ions and ions with higher charges. The cation (Na⁺) is the same in all these compounds. The anions are halides (F⁻, Cl⁻, Br⁻, I⁻). The size of halide ions increases down the group (F⁻ < Cl⁻ < Br⁻ < I⁻). Smaller ions lead to a shorter distance between cation and anion centers and stronger electrostatic attraction. Therefore, NaF, with the smallest anion (F⁻), has the strongest ionic bonding and the highest melting point among the sodium halides."

        question: "35) Excess of sodium hydroxide solution is added to a beaker containing aluminum sulphate.\nWhich of the following exist in the beaker after the end of the reaction ?",
        options: [
            "a) H₂O, AlO₂⁻, Na⁺",
            "b) Al(OH)₃, SO₄²⁻, Na⁺",

            "d) H₂O, AlO₂⁻, SO₄²⁻, OH⁻, Na⁺"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3,
        correctAnswerText: "d) H₂O, AlO₂⁻, SO₄²⁻, OH⁻, Na⁺",
        explanation: "Aluminum sulfate (Al₂(SO₄)₃) is a salt containing Al³⁺ and SO₄²⁻ ions. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution contains Na⁺ and OH⁻ ions. When NaOH is added to a solution containing Al³⁺ ions, a white gelatinous precipitate of aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)₃) is formed (Page 102). The reaction is: Al³⁺(aq) + 3OH⁻(aq) → Al(OH)₃(s). If excess NaOH is added, the precipitate of Al(OH)₃ dissolves in the excess NaOH solution to form soluble sodium metaluminate (NaAlO₂) (Page 102). The reaction is: Al(OH)₃(s) + OH⁻(aq) → [Al(OH)₄]⁻(aq) or commonly written as Al(OH)₃(s) + NaOH(aq) → NaAlO₂(aq) + 2H₂O(l). So, after adding excess NaOH, Al³⁺ is no longer present as a precipitate, but as the soluble metaluminate ion (AlO₂⁻ or [Al(OH)₄]⁻). The spectator ions from the original solutions are SO₄²⁻ (from Al₂(SO₄)₃) and Na⁺ (from NaOH). Since excess NaOH was added, there will still be OH⁻ ions present in the solution. The solvent is water (H₂O). Therefore, the species existing in the beaker are H₂O (solvent), AlO₂⁻ (or [Al(OH)₄]⁻) (soluble aluminum species), SO₄²⁻ (sulfate ions), Na⁺ (sodium ions), and excess OH⁻ ions. Option d lists H₂O, AlO₂⁻, SO₄²⁻, OH⁻, and Na⁺, which includes all the expected species in solution."

        correctAnswer: 0,
        correctAnswerText: "a) NaOH / CO₂/ Washing soda.",
        explanation: "Page 103 describes the preparation of sodium carbonate in the laboratory. It involves dissolving sodium hydroxide (NaOH) in water (X). Heating this solution is not explicitly mentioned for the lab preparation of sodium carbonate by bubbling CO₂, but dissolving solids often involves heating. Then, passing carbon dioxide gas (Y) through the solution produces sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). Allowing the solution to cool separates crystals of hydrated sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃.10H₂O), known as washing soda (Z). The process described matches the lab preparation using NaOH (X), CO₂ (Y), producing washing soda (Z)."

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        correctAnswerText: "b) The mass of crystallization water is less than double that of the anhydrous salt.",
        explanation: "Washing soda is hydrated sodium carbonate, Na₂CO₃.10H₂O (Page 103). In 1 mol of washing soda, the mass of the anhydrous salt (Na₂CO₃) is 106 g/mol. The mass of the crystallization water (10 H₂O) is 10 * 18 g/mol = 180 g/mol. Let's compare the mass of water (180 g) to the mass of the anhydrous salt (106 g). 180 g is not equal to, half of, or double 106 g. Half of 106 g is 53 g. Double 106 g is 212 g. The mass of water (180 g) is less than double the mass of the anhydrous salt (212 g). Option b states the mass of water is less than double that of the anhydrous salt (180 g < 2 * 106 g = 212 g), which is correct."

        ],
        correctAnswer: 1,
        correctAnswerText: "b) NaAlO₂, AlCl₃",
        explanation: "We need to identify the pair where both substances are soluble in water. Al(OH)₃ (aluminum hydroxide) is a precipitate formed when NaOH is added to Al³⁺ solution, and it dissolves in excess NaOH (Page 102), but it is generally insoluble in pure water. NaOH (Sodium hydroxide) dissolves easily in water (Page 101). So a is incorrect. NaAlO₂ (sodium metaluminate) is soluble in water, formed when Al(OH)₃ dissolves in excess NaOH (Page 102). AlCl₃ (aluminum chloride) is a typical ionic salt that dissolves in water (used as a solution on page 102). So b is likely correct. Cu(OH)₂ (copper(II) hydroxide) is a blue precipitate (Page 102), insoluble in water. NaCl (Sodium chloride) dissolves in water (Page 98 Note). So c is incorrect. CaCO₃ (calcium carbonate) is insoluble in water (precipitate on page 103). Na₂CO₃ (Sodium carbonate) dissolves easily in water (Page 104). So d is incorrect. Therefore, only option b contains two substances that are generally soluble in water."

        question: "40) In Solvay process, gas (W) is dissolved in a saturated solution of substance (X),\nand then the gas (Y) is passed in the former mixture with heating,\nsubstance (Z) can be obtained.\nWhich of the following identifies correctly any of (W), (X), (Y) and (Z) ?",

            "d) (W) : NH₃, (Z) : Na₂CO₃"
        ],
        correctAnswer: 3, // Answer based on the provided key on Page 48.
        correctAnswerText: "d) (W) : NH₃, (Z) : Na₂CO₃",
        explanation: "Page 104 describes the Solvay process for preparing sodium carbonate in industry. Ammonia gas (NH₃) is dissolved in a saturated aqueous solution of sodium chloride (NaCl). Carbon dioxide gas (CO₂) is then passed through this ammoniated brine. This forms sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) and ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl). Heating the sodium bicarbonate then yields sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃). Let's re-read the question carefully. Gas (W) is dissolved in saturated solution of (X). Gas (Y) is passed through the mixture with heating. Substance (Z) is obtained. The description in the question is slightly different from the process described on page 104, which says NH₃ and CO₂ are passed through NaCl solution. Let's match options to the Solvay process on page 104.\nStep 1: NH₃(g) + H₂O + NaCl(aq) + CO₂(g) → NaHCO₃(aq) + NH₄Cl(aq)\nStep 2: 2NaHCO₃(aq) → Na₂CO₃(aq) + H₂O(v) + CO₂(g) (upon heating)\nLet's assume the question describes a slightly different sequence or emphasizes certain steps. Option d: (W) = NH₃, (Z) = Na₂CO₃. In Solvay process, NH₃ is used (though often as a solution step), and Na₂CO₃ is the final product (Z) obtained by heating NaHCO₃. Let's see if other parts fit. If (W) is NH₃, its dissolved in saturated NaCl (X). Then CO₂ (Y) is passed. This forms NaHCO₃ (intermediate) and NH₄Cl. Heating NaHCO₃ gives Na₂CO₃ (Z). So (X)=NaCl, (Y)=CO₂, (W)=NH₃, intermediate=NaHCO₃, (Z)=Na₂CO₃. Let's check option d again: (W): NH₃, (Z): Na₂CO₃. This matches key parts of the Solvay process. Let's check other options based on this assignment. Option a: (W): CO₂, (Z): NaHCO₃. CO₂ is involved, NaHCO₃ is an intermediate. Doesn't fully match. Option b: (X): NH₄Cl, (Y): NH₃. NH₄Cl is a byproduct, NH₃ is a reactant. Doesn't match. Option c: (X): NaCl, (Y): H₂. NaCl is used, H₂ is not involved. Doesn't match. Option d has elements that fit the Solvay process roles (NH₃ as a gas reactant dissolved, Na₂CO₃ as a final product from heating an intermediate). Given the ambiguity in the question sequence compared to the text, matching key substances to roles (W, X, Y, Z) is the approach. Based on option d, W is NH₃, X is saturated NaCl solution, Y is CO₂, and heating is applied to the intermediate (NaHCO₃) to get Z (Na₂CO₃). The keys answer d aligns with NH₃ being a gas reactant (W) and Na₂CO₃ being the final product (Z). The question phrasing might be simplified or slightly rearranged from the detailed description on page 104. The answer is provided according to the key, linking NH₃ to W and Na₂CO₃ to Z in the Solvay process."

        correctAnswer: 1,
        correctAnswerText: "b) (X) : Acid / (Y) : Salt.",
        explanation: "In the first equation, Na₂CO₃ (Sodium carbonate, a salt/base) reacts with X to produce Y, water, and carbon dioxide gas. Reactions of carbonates with acids produce CO₂, water, and a salt (Page 104). Therefore, X is likely an acid, and Y is a salt. Let's test this hypothesis with the second equation. NaOH (Sodium hydroxide, a strong base) reacts with X to produce Y and water. Reactions between a base and an acid produce a salt and water (neutralization reaction) (Page 101 shows NaOH + HCl → NaCl + H₂O). If X is an acid and Y is a salt, the second equation is consistent with a base-acid reaction. Thus, (X) is an Acid, and (Y) is a Salt. Option b matches this."
