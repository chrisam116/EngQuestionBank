        correctAnswer: 0, // a) hydrogen bonds. (According to key on Page 43)
        correctAnswerText: "a) hydrogen bonds.",
        explanation: "Hydrogen bonds are weak intermolecular forces formed between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like O, N, or F) and another electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons. Water molecules (H<sub>2</sub>O) form hydrogen bonds between the oxygen of one molecule and the hydrogen of another (Page 71-72).<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> Water molecules interact via hydrogen bonding due to the polarity of the O–H bond and the presence of lone pairs on oxygen.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b><br>• Ionic bonds occur between metals and non-metals.<br>• Coordinate bonds involve a lone pair donation from one atom to another (water forms coordinate bonds when reacting with H<sup>+</sup> to form H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>, but the bonds *between* neutral water molecules are hydrogen bonds).<br>• Metallic bonds occur in metal lattices.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> See page 71-72, sections on 'The hydrogen bond' and 'Hydrogen bonds among water molecules'."

        options: ["a) HF", "b) HCl", "c) NH<sub>3</sub>", "d) H<sub>2</sub>O"],
        correctAnswer: 1, // b) HCl (According to key on Page 43)
        correctAnswerText: "b) HCl",
        explanation: "Hydrogen bonds typically form when hydrogen is bonded to highly electronegative atoms like Fluorine (F), Oxygen (O), or Nitrogen (N). HF, NH<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O molecules contain H bonded to F, N, and O respectively, and thus form hydrogen bonds between molecules (Page 72 lists these as examples). In HCl, Chlorine is less electronegative than F, O, or N, and while the bond is polar, the hydrogen bonding between HCl molecules is significantly weaker or negligible compared to the others listed.<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> HCl does not form strong hydrogen bonds like the other listed compounds.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b> HF, NH<sub>3</sub>, and H<sub>2</sub>O all form significant hydrogen bonds.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> See page 72, 'Examples of hydrogen bonds'."

        options: ["a) Single and double covalent bonds.", "b) Single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.", "c) Double covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.", "d) Single and double covalent bonds, and hydrogen bonds."],
        correctAnswer: 1, // b) Single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds. (According to key on Page 43)
        correctAnswerText: "b) Single covalent bonds and hydrogen bonds.",
        explanation: "Ethanol (CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>OH) contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms linked by covalent bonds. Within the molecule, there are C-C, C-H, C-O, and O-H single covalent bonds. The presence of the O-H group means that ethanol molecules can form hydrogen bonds with each other (hydrogen bonded to oxygen) (similar to water, Page 72). There are no double bonds in ethanol.<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> Ethanol has only single covalent bonds within the molecule and forms hydrogen bonds between molecules.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b> Ethanol does not contain double bonds.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> General knowledge of organic molecule structure and hydrogen bonding criteria (H bonded to O)."

        question: "4 Which two compounds can bind to each other through hydrogen bonds ?",

        correctAnswer: 0, // a) CH3COOH and C2H5OH (According to key on Page 43)
        correctAnswerText: "a) CH<sub>3</sub>COOH and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH",
        explanation: "For hydrogen bonding to occur between two different molecules, at least one molecule must have a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (like O, N, F), and the other molecule must have a highly electronegative atom with a lone pair.<br>a) CH<sub>3</sub>COOH (acetic acid) has an O-H group and C=O (oxygen with lone pairs). C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH (ethanol) has an O-H group and oxygen with lone pairs.

        explanation: "Alkali metals are in Group 1A and have a valence electron configuration of ns<sup>1</sup> (Page 90). Let's analyze the options:<br>a) 2, 1 (shell configuration): This represents an element with electrons in 2 shells, with 1 electron in the outermost shell. This is Lithium (Li), 1s<sup>2</sup> 2s<sup>1</sup>. Li is an alkali metal.<br>b) [Ne], 4s<sup>1</sup>: [Ne] represents the core electrons (Z=10). 4s<sup>1</sup> indicates the valence electron is in the 4s orbital. This would be element Z=10+1=11, but the valence electron is in 4s. The element with Z=11 is Sodium (Na), which has configuration [Ne] 3s<sup>1</sup>. This is not a standard ground state configuration for an alkali metal.<br>c) [Ar], 4s<sup>2</sup>, 3d<sup>10</sup>, 4p<sup>6</sup>, 5s<sup>1</sup>: [Ar] represents the core (Z=18). Adding 4s<sup>2</sup>, 3d<sup>10</sup>, 4p<sup>6</sup> fills the n=4 shell and 3d sublevel, resulting in Z=18+2+10+6=36, which is Krypton ([Kr]). Adding 5s<sup>1</sup> gives Z=36+1=37, which is Rubidium (Rb). The standard configuration for Rb is [Kr] 5s<sup>1</sup> or [Ar] 3d<sup>10</sup> 4s<sup>2</sup> 4p<sup>6</sup> 5s<sup>1</sup>. Rb is an alkali metal.<br>d) [Xe], 6s<sup>1</sup>: [Xe] represents the core (Z=54). 6s<sup>1</sup> indicates the valence electron is in the 6s orbital. This is element Z=54+1=55, which is Cesium (Cs). Cs is an alkali metal.<br>Options 'a', 'c', and 'd' represent alkali metals. Option 'b' uses incorrect notation for an alkali metal configuration (an element with Ne core having its valence electron in 4s). Therefore, option 'b' is the one that *does not* represent a correct electron configuration of an alkali metal.<br>However, the provided answer key on Page 47 states that option 'c' is the answer.

        explanation: "Sodium (Na) has one valence electron ([Ne] 3s<sup>1</sup>). It readily loses this electron to form Na<sup>+</sup> ([Ne]), achieving a stable noble gas configuration. The energy required to remove this first electron (first ionization potential) is relatively low. However, to form Na<sup>2+</sup>, a second electron would need to be removed from the very stable, filled core electron shell ([Ne]). This requires a very large amount of energy, corresponding to a very high second ionization potential (Page 90). Therefore, the +2 oxidation state is not normally observed for sodium.<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> The high energy required to remove a second electron from sodium's stable noble gas core electron configuration prevents it from typically forming a +2 ion.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b> Sodium has a relatively low first ionization potential (it loses the first electron easily).

        explanation: "Cesium (Cs) is below Potassium (K) in Group 1A. Down the group, atomic mass increases (a is incorrect), atomic size increases (b is correct, Page 92), ionization potential decreases (meaning it is easier to lose an electron, hence higher ability to be ionized, so c is incorrect as stated, lower ionization potential = higher ability to be ionized, Page 90), and chemical activity increases (d is incorrect, Page 94).

        correctAnswerText: "c) M<sub>2</sub>O",
        explanation: "A metal with the largest atomic size in its period is an alkali metal (Group 1A) (Page 92). If its electrons are distributed in 6 energy sublevels, and assuming this refers to the principal energy levels, this would mean electrons occupy shells up to n=6.

        correctAnswerText: "a) NaF",
        explanation: "Sodium halides (NaF, NaCl, NaBr, NaI) are ionic compounds. The melting point of ionic compounds is related to the strength of the ionic bond, which is quantified by lattice energy. Lattice energy is directly proportional to the product of the charges of the ions and inversely proportional to the distance between the centers of the ions (sum of ionic radii). In these compounds, the charges are constant (+1 for Na<sup>+</sup>, -1 for halide ion). Therefore, the lattice energy depends on the size of the halide ion. Ionic radius increases down the halogen group: F<sup>−</sup> < Cl<sup>−</sup> < Br<sup>−</sup> < I<sup>−</sup>.

        explanation: "Alkali metals are strong reducing agents and are difficult to reduce from their compounds chemically. They are extracted by electrolysis of their molten (fused) salts (Page 100).

        question: "44 The common ions present in the living cell are .........",
        options: ["a) Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.", "b) K<sup>+</sup> ions.", "c) Li<sup>+</sup> ions.", "d) Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions."],
        correctAnswer: 1, // b) K+ ions. (According to key on Page 48)
        correctAnswerText: "b) K<sup>+</sup> ions.",
        explanation: "Page 106 discusses the biochemical role of Sodium and Potassium ions. It explicitly states that Potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) are common ions found *inside* the living cell. Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) are common in blood plasma and intercellular fluids.<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> Potassium ions are explicitly mentioned as common ions inside living cells.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b> While Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions are also biologically important, K<sup>+</sup> is specifically highlighted as common *inside* the living cell in the text. Li<sup>+</sup> is not a common essential ion.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> See page 106, 'The biochemical role of sodium and potassium ions'."

        question: "45 The living cell transfers (X) through (Y).\nWhich of the following represents (X) and (Y) respectively ?",
        options: ["a) K<sup>+</sup> / Glucose.", "b) Proteins / Na<sup>+</sup>", "c) K<sup>+</sup> / Proteins.", "d) Glucose / Na<sup>+</sup>"],
        correctAnswer: 3, // d) Glucose / Na+ (According to key on Page 48)
        correctAnswerText: "d) Glucose / Na<sup>+</sup>",
        explanation: "Page 106 states that Sodium and Potassium ions represent the required medium to transfer *nutrients*, such as glucose and amino acids. It also mentions K<sup>+</sup> ions play a role in the oxidation of glucose in the living cell. While both ions are involved in transport, the text mentions the transfer of *glucose* (a nutrient) and highlights the role of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> in this process.<br>Common biological transport mechanisms involve moving nutrients like glucose across cell membranes, often coupled with the movement of ions like Na<sup>+</sup> (co-transport). The question asks for the substance being transferred (X) and the substance involved in the transfer mechanism (Y). Glucose (X) is a nutrient being transferred, and Na<sup>+</sup> (Y) is an ion involved in the transport process (e.g., driving glucose transport across the membrane).<br><br><b>Why this answer is correct:</b> Glucose is a nutrient transferred by the cell, and Na<sup>+</sup> ions are involved in the transport mechanisms for nutrients like glucose.<br><b>Why other options are incorrect:</b> Options involve ions as the transferred substance or incorrectly pair substances/ions.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> See page 106, 'The biochemical role of sodium and potassium ions', mentioning the transfer of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids."
