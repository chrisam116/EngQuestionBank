        correctAnswer: 1, // Highlighted is 'arrested'. This question is problematic.
        correctAnswerText: "b)arrested",
        explanation: "This is a reduced relative clause. 'Arrested' here implies 'who were arrested'. If the thieves were arrested last Friday, it would be illogical for them to then rob the bank. However, grammatically, 'arrested' can function as a past participle in a reduced passive clause (e.g., 'the thieves [who were] arrested'). The full sentence implies a logical inconsistency in the premise itself. Why this answer is correct: 'Arrested' can function as a past participle in a reduced relative clause (e.g., 'the thieves [who were] arrested'). Why other options are incorrect: Who arrested is active (implying the thieves arrested someone), been arrested is incomplete without 'had been' or 'have been', and arresting is present participle.<br><br><b>Reference:</b> Grammar: Reduced Relative Clauses."
